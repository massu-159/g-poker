- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Two players want to enjoy the popular German bluffing card game "ごきぶりポーカー" (Cockroach Poker) on their mobile devices through online multiplayer. This MVP version focuses on remote gameplay where Player 1 and Player 2 use separate devices, passing cards face-down while making claims about creature types (which may be lies). Each player must decide whether to believe the claim or pass the card back. The goal is to avoid collecting 3 of the same creature type, as this results in losing the game (modified from original 4 for faster gameplay).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** two players join an online game, **When** cards are dealt, **Then** each player receives 9 cards on their device (6 cards remain hidden for randomness)
2. **Given** Player 1's turn, **When** they select a card and make a creature claim, **Then** Player 2 receives notification on their device
3. **Given** Player 2 receives a card claim, **When** they choose to guess or pass back, **Then** system synchronizes game state across both devices
4. **Given** a player guesses correctly about a lie, **When** the claim was false, **Then** the liar receives the penalty card
5. **Given** a player accumulates 3 cards of the same creature type, **When** the penalty is applied, **Then** that player loses and game ends

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all cards are exhausted before either player loses?
- How does the app handle network disconnections during gameplay?
- What happens when a player takes too long to respond during online play?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
